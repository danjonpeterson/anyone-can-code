>"Come on ev'rybody, I say now let's play a game  
I betcha I can make a rhyme out of anybody's name  
The first letter of the name
I treat it like it wasn't there  
But a "B" or an "F" or an "M" will appear"

...

>But if the first two letters are ever the same  
Crop them both, then say the name  
Like Bob, Bob, drop the "B's", Bo-ob  
Or Fred, Fred, drop the "F's", Fo-red  
Or Mary, Mary, drop the "M's", Mo-ary  
That's the only rule that is contrary
